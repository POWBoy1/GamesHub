# Games Hub

Play games during school without raising suspicion!  
This project disguises the browser tab as **Google Classroom**, including both the **tab name** and **icon**, so even if a teacher uses a tab checker, it blends right in.

## Features
- Google Classroom style **tab name**
- Google Classroom style **icon**
- Easy to use, just open and play
- Updated Frequently!

## Notes
- some games might not work, if it's Blocked/Broken/Buggy I'll change the Provider.
- Some of the Updates were used with AI
