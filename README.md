# Games Hub

Play games during school without raising suspicion!  
This project disguises the browser tab as **Google Classroom**, including both the **tab name** and **icon**, so even if a teacher uses a tab checker, it blends right in.

## Features
- Google Classroom style **tab name**
- Google Classroom style **icon**

- Updated Frequently!
- Open Source! So you can create your own Games Hub!

## Notes
- This project use a lot of different website for the games, So some of them might not work/Blocked.
- some games might not work, if it's blocked then I'll figure out a way.
